# Perfect numbers
A Python program to find perfect numbers. This project is a Platzi Master program assesment. 

## Features
Find perfect numbers lower than a passed N number. The program uses an efficient algorithm to find divisors. 
Also implements Python `multiprocessing` to use all the cores of the machine it is running on in order to optimize
time of execution.

## Dependencies
You only need Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine or in a virtual environment. 

## Run the project
To run the project:
```sh
python perfect_numbers.py
```
Then the program asks for the value of N.
